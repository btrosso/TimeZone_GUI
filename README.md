# TimeZone Buddy App
## Current Version
- 2022.1

## Description
This project was inspired from a group of new friends I met during a python bootcamp course. It has been my first real 
attempt at collaborative programming. (Shoutout to @JameaPlays for helping me stumble through this first collaborative 
effort and contributing to the project in a major way!)

This application was created to help us keep track of our buddies in different time zones and to whether or not they 
might be awake or asleep based on their time. 

## Key Features
- Current User Time
- Ability to Add a buddy to your list of buddies
- Selecting the TimeZone for the buddy
